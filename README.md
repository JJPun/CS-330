I approach designing software like i would build a pyramid. 
Start with the base, or planning, and work my way up.
Starting with a wider and stable base can let you build the pyramid taller and more stable. Good planning is paramount to ensuring you meet all customer needs and company needs as well.
I had a lot of trouble with 3D design and coding for OpenGL. Honestly, it reminded me of how I do not want to do any coding for games despite my love for video games.
This course definitely gave me more of an appreciation for game coders. 
Working on the 3D scecne was frustrating to say the least.
I spent a lot of time rewatching videos, going through the course and googling how to do certain things online when all else failed. 
I had a lot of help from a friend as well who is working as a programmer right now. 
Computer science can help me reach my goal of getting a coding job. I find coding to be frustrating but fun because it is almost like solving a puzzle and excersizes the brain.
Obviously there is the monetary value attaached with such a demanding and potentially very hard job that is enticing. 
Financial freedom is something I wish for as I am sure most people do, so that I can do the things I love.
Things like traveling and eating good food!
